# Task 4: Forecast Results and Interpretation (2025-2027)

## Executive Summary
Our forecasting model, utilizing a logistic growth trend augmented by event impact scenarios, projects that Ethiopia will continue its steady progress in financial inclusion but will **likely miss the ambitious NFIS-II target of 70% by 2025**.

## 1. Forecast Table (Account Ownership)

| Year | Conservative (Baseline) | Optimistic (Policy Success) | 95% Confidence Interval |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **2025** | **52.3%** | **53.8%** | 49% - 55% |
| **2026** | **55.1%** | **58.1%** | 51% - 59% |
| **2027** | **58.0%** | **62.5%** | 53% - 63% |

*   **Status Quo**: Growth continues at the historical organic rate (~3pp per year).
*   **Optimistic**: Assumes the NFIS-II strategy begins to yield results (rural agent networks, interoperability), adding ~1.5pp extra growth per year.

## 2. Key Insights
1.  **The "Last Mile" Challenge**: The logistic curve flattens as we approach 50-60%, representing the difficulty of reaching rural, uneducated, or extremely poor populations after the "easy" urban adoption is saturated.
2.  **Target Gap**: The data indicates a ~18 percentage point gap between the 2025 forecast (52%) and the target (70%). Bridging this requires **disruptive** change, not just incremental improvement.
3.  **Usage vs. Access**: While formal access grows slowly, we project "Usage" (Digital Payments) to likely outpace Access, potentially reaching **45-50% by 2026** driven by Telebirr/M-Pesa P2P utility, even if users don't consider themselves "banked."

## 3. Key Uncertainties
*   **Mobile Money "Active" Definition**: If the NBE reclassifies verified level-2 mobile wallet users as "banked," the 70% target becomes achievable overnight.
*   **Macroeconomic Stability**: Inflation or instability could dampen the organic growth rate (k).

## 4. Policy Recommendations
*   **Revisit Definitions**: Align "Financial Inclusion" definitions with the reality of Mobile Money usage.
*   **Interoperability**: Accelerate EthSwitch implementations to make wallets fully fungible with bank accounts.
