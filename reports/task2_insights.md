## Key Insights

1. **Slowdown in Account Ownership Growth (2021-2024)**: Despite the massive boom in mobile money users (Telebirr > 50M), formal account ownership only grew by 3 percentage points (46% to 49%). This suggests a significant overlap: many new mobile money users likely already had accounts, or these accounts are not being considered "financial institution accounts" in the same way definition-wise, though Findex usually includes mobile money. It warrants investigation into "registered vs active" definition differences.

2. **Gender Gap Persistence**: Men (57%) continue to outpace Women (42%) in account ownership. The gap remains a structural barrier to full inclusion.

3. **Urban-Rural Divide**: A massive gap exists (Urban 73% vs Rural 43%). Inclusion is heavily skewed towards urban centers.

4. **Impact of Telebirr**: Telebirr's launch in May 2021 correlates with the period of massive user acquisition, yet the *net* new inclusion (unbanked to banked) effect seems slower than the user registration numbers imply.

5. **Infrastructure as a Leading Indicator**: 4G coverage and smartphone penetration (implied by app-based digital payments) are critical. The high usage of digital payments (35% made/received) compared to wages (15%) suggests peer-to-peer transfers are a primary driver.
